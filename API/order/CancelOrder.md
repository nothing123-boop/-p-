# Cancel Order

If the customer wants to switch to USDT after selecting BTC. She/he will cancel order and reselect. Itâ€™s done by MugglePay Invoice page. ONLY use this if you want to build an in-house payment without redirecting to MugglePay Invoice page.

It is to avoid order conflict, if the client cannot get successful payment result or any response from MugglePay, it should send a cancel request to MugglePay to cancel the failed order.

Use it when the order status is NEW.
